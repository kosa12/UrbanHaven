# Single Page WebApp for Real-Estate

## Task:

You will make a NextJS spa webapp with Typescript and Tailwind. I have already a functional Java Spring Api server with all the crud functionalities, for the real-estate (ingatlan from now on) and their landlords (tulajdonos).
I want a fully functional webapp with the following functionalities:

- all the CRUD
- responsive design
- Authn/Authz
- Theming (light/dark)
- Use MUI
- Languages (hungarian/english/romanian)
- PWA workbox and manifest
- PWA service worker cache
